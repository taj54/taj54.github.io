# Creating a personal portfolio is one of the best ways to showcase your skills and projects. In this post, I’ll walk through how I built mine using **Jekyll**, **Docker**, and **GitHub Pages**.

---

## 🧱 Why Jekyll?

- Native support by GitHub Pages
- Markdown-based content writing
- Simple templating system with Liquid

## 🐳 Why Docker?

- No need to install Ruby or Jekyll locally
- Isolated environment for development
- Easy to replicate on any machine

## 🚀 Deployment with GitHub Pages

- Just push to `main` or `gh-pages` branch
- GitHub builds and hosts the site for free

---

## 🧪 Bonus Tips

- Use `_config.yml` to define global settings
- Keep your `assets/` organized for images and styles
- Use custom layouts for different sections (e.g. blog, project, privacy)
